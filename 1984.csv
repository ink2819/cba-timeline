This exhibition, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Center for Book Arts in New York, illustrates these movements in its display of 132 works by 112 artists, selected from the work of the Center's almost one thousand members. The exhibition is not intended as a retrospective but rather as an overview of members' diverse approaches to contemporary book art and, to a great degree, of their current interests."
