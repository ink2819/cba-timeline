Full color. 9 x 12 inches. Hardcover. ""'7 Miles a Second' is the story of legendary artist David Wojnarowicz, written during the last years before his AIDS-related death in 1992. Artists James Romberger and Marguerite Van Cook unsentimentally depict Wojnarowicz's childhood of hustling on the streets of Manhattan, through his adulthood living with AIDS, and his anger at the indifference of government and health agencies. A primal scream of a graphic novel, 7 Miles a Second blends the stark reality of Lower East Side street life with a psychedelic delirium that artfully conveys Wojnarowicz's sense of rage, urgency, mortality and a refusal to be silent. ""Originally published as a comic book in 1996 by DC's Vertigo Comics, '7 Miles a Second' was an instant critical success and has become a cult classic amongst fans of literary and art comics, just as Wojnarowicz's influence and reputation have widened in the larger art world. This new edition finally presents the artwork as it was intended: oversized, and with Van Cook's elegant watercolors restored.

Utilizing a step-by-step structure in which each lesson builds upon those that precede it, Zelevansky's book considers what makes pictures --in collusion and competition with words -- alternatively powerful and unreliable as representations of reality. 24 Ideas About Pictures incorporates an eclectic mix of examples with an emphasis on commonplace images (clip art, postcards, family, snapshots, road signs, puzzles and games) whose stereotypical forms and meanings are so mundane as to recede in the background of daily life. Pictures look like us, flatter our assumptions and fuel the market as products and ideas, but more fundamentally they are a form of currency that allows us to barter and exchange our beliefs, hopes and fears."" -- printedmatter.org",,,,Digital version,,Great Blankness Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The book documents individuals featured in a 2017 Art Basel exhibit. Description of exhibit from the Art Basel website: The admittance of women to the University of Basel was a rather belated development; it wasn't until 1890 that women were permitted to study there. The first time a woman became an associate professor was in 1928, the first appointment of a woman to a bona fide professorship only came in 1964. The historic lecture room of the Basel University is decorated with 102 paintings depicting former professors and researchers. The last portrait was added to the gallery in 1914, guaranteeing the palpable absence of the female scientist. It is the practice of Belgian artist Sophie Nys to explore themes like history, politics, and culture. In this takeaway artist publication 102 craters on Venus, she examines the historic exclusion of the achievements of female scientists by preeminent institutions of higher learning.","['exhibitions', 'science', 'women']",,,Exhibition webpage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Printed and bound by Ex Libris Press in an edition of 400. ""In 'Otono (sic)', Luis Moreno Villamediana (1966) seeks to express the experience of foreignness and dislocation. The erratum in the title mirrors the sense of inadequacy common to migration and diasporic life. Besides, it shows the omission of the Spanish tilde, thus introducing the conviction of error into the body of the work. The poems in the book were mostly written during a stay in Italy, and include translations, wordplays, excursions into a strange land, and linguistic oddities. In the end, they tell the well-known story of exodus and its meager but overcharged baggage of absence, discomfort, and loss. The ethics and aesthetics of the castaway that Gustavo Guerrero has noted in Moreno Villamediana's previous texts is maximized and exalted in Otono (sic)."" -- artist's statement",,poetry,,Artist's website,,Letra Muerta,,,Luis Moreno Villamediana,,,,,,,,,Ex Libris Press,,,,,Ex Libris Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Throughout the 80s, 90s, and early 00s, Dover published many 'Ready-To-Use' spot illustration collections, with titles like 'Men's Heads,' 'Senior Citizens,' and 'Appliances and Electronics,' for both commercial and personal use. ""The tropes taken as inspiration are often benign--the conucopias in 'Gourment Foods' recall antiquity--others, like 'Weddings' (of white, straight couples) or 'Oriental Designs,' range from dated to patently offensive. Depicting a wide range of professions and repeated in several sizes to accommodate a variety of uses, many of the read-to-use clip-art designs in 'Women at Work' are thus outliers. They posit soldier, firefighter and mother as equal (working) women, insisting on the legitimacy of all roles for women in society--a still unpopular notion. Yet other depicted professions, like masseuse, manicurist, or secretary, reaffirm stereotypes that persist today--a stark reminder that forward progress on gender equality continues to be a matter of two steps forward, one step back."" -- colophon.","['clip art', 'illustrations', 'paintings', 'pamphlet bindings']",,,,,Peradam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, Gramcko's poetry surpasses any formal elements associated with the work of her contemporaries. Within the fabric of her well-measured lines, the precocious Ida Gramcko undertook an inquiry into the mystery of beings, objects, language, life. Her deep concern with metaphysical problems turns her metaphors into philosophemes. Gramcko's Poemas (1947-1952) represent the summit of her lyrical achievement and epitomize her standpoint about literary tradition and poetic protocols. For her, poetry must strive for unforeseen realities and observations; in her own words: 'We invent/a new lime wall... and it's so different!/A new wall, rare?'"" -- artist's statement","['manuscripts', 'photographs', 'poetry']",,,Artist's website,,Letra Muerta,,,Ida Gramcko,,,,,,,,,Ex Libris Press,,,,,Ex Libris Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rafael Castillo Zapata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Public Access is an art project produced by David Horvitz in late December 2010 and early January 2011. For roughly two weeks, he drove along California's coast from the Mexican border up through the Oregon border. Along the way, he stopped and took pictures of himself looking out at the beach and other scenic vantage points, his stance recalling the iconic romantic painting Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog by Caspar David Friedrich from 1818 and Bas Jan Ader's 1971 Farewell to Faraway Friends. He then uploaded these photographs to the Wikipedia entries for these locations, adding new images or replacing existent images. This action produced a flurry of discussion amongst the Wikipedia community, as its members tried to figure out his identity and the purpose of the photos. Many of the original photos were cropped or deleted entirely. Graphic designer Eric Nylund designed the publication, which includes a text written by Ed Steck. This was made for the exhibition ""As Yet Untitled: Artists and Writers in Collaboration"" at SF Camerawork in San Francisco.""","['offset printing', 'paperbacks', 'travel photography']",,,,,Publication Studio,,,Ed Steck,,,,,,,,Eric Nylund,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,David Horvitz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The abstract quality of the images do not intend to portray the place in which the work was made, but rather emphasize how homogeneous and indistinguishable the urban landscapes in our cities have become. To better understand how one constructs a personal identity within these surroundings, the artist examines the relationships between lines and borders on sidewalks buildings to observe how they come together, interact and ultimately shape and guide our every day journeys. The asymmetrical composition illustrates how two different spaces divided by a border can exist inclusively side by side, rather than being divided. The sequence of images represents the artist's specific journey as depicted in the book, however the images are paired with solid planes of color allowing the viewer to disassemble and recreate a visual journey of their own."" -- colophon ""'All Roads Lead to You' is a visual study of lines and borders that define New York City's streets.

Mogel tracked down various historic locations that have gone unnoticed to the unassuming eye or altogether hidden in plain sight by new development, landscape reconfiguration or changed policies. Each route leads individuals on a path of discovery of unconventional locations linked via a shared purpose and history that has otherwise only been the knowledge of a select few. This project was commissioned by the Washington, DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities for the 5x5 public art exhibition, in which 5 curators each chose 5 artists to create site-specific public art works.

Ridley Stroop who first published the phenomenon in English in 1935. The Stroop test demonstrates reaction time. When the name of a color ('blue,' 'green,' or 'red') is printed in a color not denoted by the name (the word 'red' printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. It is often used as a measure of impulsiveness, and is one of the most commonly used diagnostic tools in clinical psychology. The brain must focus on one particular feature of a task, while blocking out other features. An Artist's ability to focus on the color of the color and note the meaning of the word might allow better than average reaction times. if the test is taken upside down, reaction times will decrease due to less interference. If a person does not understand the meaning of the words, there will be no conflict. The vast majority of research regarding the Stroop effect has focused on why 'facilitation' and 'interference' occur and the underlying brain mechanisms. (To take the test, compare the amount to time taken to read the words in black or in the correct colors (facilitation) to the time needed to name the colors of the words on the last page (interference).

I decided to follow him,"" she writes at the beginning of Suite Venitienne, her first artist's book and the crucible of her inimitable fusion of investigatory methods, fictional constructs, the plundering of real life and the composition of self. Over the course of almost two weeks in Venice, Calle notates, in time-stamped entries, her surveillance of Henri B., as well as her own emotions as she seeks, finds and follows him through the labyrinthine streets of Venice. Her investigation is both methodical (calling every hotel, visiting the police station) and arbitrary (sometimes following a stranger-a flower delivery boy, for instance-hoping someone might lead her to him). This Siglio reissue is a reprint of Suite Venitienne (first published in 1988 and long out of print).

CBA copy 1. In 2008, a group of collaborators gather in Chicago to sign, address and send letters to every prisoner in Illinois' Tamms C-Max Supermax Prison. In their correspondence they asked the men if they wish to participate in ""Supermax Subscriptions,"" a program that exchanges frequent flier miles with magazine subscriptions for individuals in solitary confinement. These men remain in their private cells for 23-24 hours a day, without any contact with the outside world -- no phone calls, community programs, work, or library. Many have been there for over a decade, despite the state's original intent to hold prisoners in the facility for up to two years. Responses to the letters came in almost immediately -- Tamms' prisoners wrote with their subscription preferences and the organizers matched them up with mileage donors. With simple parameters, this project exposes the inhumanity of maximum-security facilities, while enabling individuals to infiltrate these secluded confines and make a meaningful contribution to the lives of those forgotten within these walls.","['correspondence', 'incarcerating', 'maximum-security prisons', 'prisons']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our editorial brief is to publish articles that promote a clear understanding of the enormously complex and historically rich field of the book arts, including: - Scholarly, bibliographical, and historical perspectives - Artist's views on new developments in the field - Research and critical articles on contemporary book arts - Photo essays documenting studios, ateliers, and libraries - Interviews and profiles - Book and exhibition reviews / Reference shelf - Collecting contemporary book arts - Dispatches from the global community - Letters to the editor, opinion, and travel We have seen a great groundswell in the arts of printing and making of books since 1975. A few intrepid journals have come and gone while a few remain standing. We are proud to join the ranks of the standing. We hope that you will not only enjoy this premier issue but that you will subscribe to volumes two and three and so on. The CODEX Foundation's mission is to preserve and promote the arts of the book and, in the broadest possible context, to bring to public recognition the high artisanship and the rich history of printing and publishing as an instrument of civilization. The Foundation's primary focus is to create an exciting and lively marketplace for contemporary book arts. To that end we established the biennial CODEX International Book Fair and Symposium as a global resource for artists, collectors, curators, librarians, printers, students, and scholars. In support of our mission and to record the papers presented at the first CODEX International Symposium in 2007, we began publishing materials that document the intellectual ferment in the book arts of our time. In 2008 the Foundation published Book Art Object followed in 2012 by Book Art Object 2. Both volumes were received to great acclaim, broadcasting word of the CODEX Book Fair and Symposium far and wide. These substantial reference volumes (972 pages combined) were soon joined by a continuing series of smaller monographs dedicated to single themes and the artist's voice. The first CODE(X)+1 monograph, by Robert Bringhurst, was published in 2008.

Using found images and sounds as well as deconstructed scores by Handel and Vivaldi, The Foundling plays with ideas of the hidden and the lost. In a year which celebrates Baroque music this piece acknowledged the active contributions that Handel and Vivaldi both made to institutions in London and Venice respectively, dedicated to giving vulnerable and destitute children a second chance at life."" --Foundling Museum website. ""The Foundling project was developed through collaborative performances with ... Ian Dearden and ... Linda Hirst which took place at the Foundling Museum and at live performances in Venice and London. Smith used these events to workshop and construct an installation that explored not only the specific context of the museum but also wider issues around childhood and identity."" --Back flap.","['installations', 'perfect bindings', 'photography', 'wrappers']",,,,,workinprogress,,,,,,,,,,,Emma Hill,Dayfold Print,,,,,,,,2009,,,,,Neil Crawford,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Published by Penguin Books, New York, N.Y., 1998. Includes bibliographical references (p. 92-94). ISBN 9780140259971 ""We were Guerillas before we were Gorillas. From the beginning, the press wanted publicity photos. We needed a disguise. No one remembers, for sure, how we got our fur, but one story is that at an early meeting, an original Girl, a bad speller, wrote 'Gorilla' instead of'Guerilla.' It was an enlightening mistake. It gave us our mask-ulinity. Ever wonder about the abundance of naked male statues in the Classical section of your favorite museum? Did you know medieval convents were hotbeds of female artistic expression? And how did those ""bad boy"" artists of the twentieth century make it even harder for a girl to get a break? Thanks to the Guerrilla Girls, those masked feminists whose mission it is to break the white male stronghold over the art world, art history-as we know it-is history. Taking you back through the ages, the Guerrilla Girls demonstrate how males (particularly white males) have dominated the art scene, and discouraged, belittled, or obscured women's involvement. Their skeptical and hilarious interpretations of ""popular"" theory are augmented by the newest research and the expertise of prominent feminist art historians. ""Believe-it-or-not"" quotations from some of the ""experts"" are sprinkled throughout, as are the Guerrilla Girls' signature masterpieces: reproductions of famous art works, slightly ""altered"" for historic accuracy and vindication. This colorful reinterpretation of classic and modern art, as outrageous as it is visually arresting, is a much-needed corrective to traditional art history, and an unabashed celebration of female artists""--Amazon","['art history', 'art museums', 'feminism', 'political art', 'women', ""women's studies""]",,,Guerrilla Girls,,"Penguin Books, LTD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""This book was made in an edition of 35 plus 5 artist's proof copies. ...The pages are letterpress printed from handset type and photopolymer plates on both Zerkall paper and handmade paper from Cave Paper.""--colophon ""This project was initially inspired by the life and work of Orra White Hitchcock (1796-1863), one of America's earliest women botanical and scientific illustrators and artists. The book became a meditation on the passage of time, both geologic time and individual time. It also draws a connection to the book as a kind of geological artifact in itself. It is an object that represents the passage of time through the turning of pages, and within it our stories and narratives have accumulated over the centuries. The short narrative in the book is printed from hand-set metal type and designed to be read as image captions over a series of pages, and through gaps in time that the material and space of the book provide. The smooth white sheets are interspersed with textured landscapes suggesting a trajectory through the book as well as a journey over space and time. The simple, poetic narrative is broken up with stenciled, text imagery representing the accumulation of verbal deposits and the somewhat fallible nature of words to truly capture our experiences. Black thread also plays a prominent place in the visual narrative of the book. Thread is knotted, braided, and looped to create imagery that might reflect something done to calculate, control, or otherwise capture the passage of time. This imagery was inspired by the quipu, or knotted recording devices, developed during the Inca Empire.""--from the artist's website (http://www.ingebruggeman.com/The-Quickest-Forever )","['Coptic bindings', ""artists' books""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through his own imagination and fantasy, he is the only one who can try to reconstruct the narrative suggested by the words emerging from the omissis.""",,inkjet printing,,Publisher's website,,Baustellen Buero,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Foreword by Timothy Rub. Introduction by Susan Anderson Laquer with Rose Chiango and Margaret Huang. Texts by Glen Berger, Mark Polizzotti, and Tammy Nguyen This limited-edition publication celebrates Judith Young-Mallin's unique archival collection of photographs, correspondence, ephemera, audiovisual material, rare books, and artwork. Acquired by the museum in 2015, the collection features key figures in the Surrealist movement and other 20th-century cultural luminaries, including Leonora Carrington, Noma Copley, William Copley, Carol Janeway, M. F. K. Fisher, Man Ray, Yves Tanguy, and Ossip Zadkine. A Surreal Archive is a creative reinterpretation of Young-Mallin's collection by artist Tammy Nguyen, who draws from the collection to create a delightfully quirky book that celebrates the spirit of the Surrealist circle in New York and Young-Mallin's role as friend, host, and collector. At the center of the book is a pop-up version of the infamous dollhouse that Young-Mallin commissioned and populated with original works of art and dolls modeled after Man Ray, Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, and others. The fold-out book is housed in a decorative box and comes with a 16-page booklet that offers an overview of the collection and appreciations of Young-Mallin and her world by authors Glen Berger and Mark Polizzotti."" -- philamuseum.org",,pop-up books,,,,,Philadelphia Museum of Art,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Boo Hooray is proud to present a complete facsimile of The Situationist Times, Jacqueline De Jong's self published periodical, on the 50th anniversary of its inaugural issue. De Jong, a Dutch artist and graphic designer, joined the Situationist movement in 1960, and quickly assumed a position within the Central Committee. De Jong was determined to make ""a completely free magazine, based on the most creative of the Situationist ideas,"" and in 1962 she began The Situationist Times, a broad representation of a movement that had already become divided into the political and the aesthetic. The Situationist Times is one of the most visually compelling publications of it's oeuvre, initially printed offset on thick colored paper, eventually shifting to full color lithography, with contributions by artists Asger Jorn, Gruppe SPUR, and ‪Pierre Alechinsk‬y. The magazine also featured contributions by architect Aldo van Eyck, astrophysicist Fred Hoyle, mathematician Walter Eitzmann, and musical composer Peter Schat. Starting in 1962 there were six issues of The Situationist Times printed before the student uprisings of May '68, leaving a 7th issue compiled but un-published. Boo-Hooray's facsimile of the The Situationist Times is released in a box set edition of 1000. The six issues are bound individually and enclosed in a silk-screened slipcase.

From 1923 until his death in 1938, by the sheer force of his personality and his command of the military, he fashioned Turkish culture through the prism of his vision for a secular state. He created a new sense of nationalism, exiled the Sultan and diminished the power of religion by abolishing the Sunni Muslim Caliphate. The wearing of religious clothing was banned in public. In an effort to identify Turkey as a modern and Western state, Mustafa Kemal dropped the Arabic alphabet in favor of Latin characters, expanded secular public education, and new rights for women. He required that everyone adopt a last name and his became 'Ataturk,' ancestor of all Turks. Between 1997 and 2009, Mandel and Zakari, one American, the other Turkish, have employed the imagery of Ataturk to create a portrait of all sides of the body politic: the symbol of the secular revolutionary hero, the power of the state that resides with the military, and in opposition, the demands for renewed religious political expression symbolized by the Islamist scarf. The State of Ata weaves together the artists' photographs of Turkish society, the public imagery and sculptural presence of Ataturk, documentation of their own interventions and performances, interviews, and a collection of archival and popular imagery. The book is conceived as a collection of books within books: a photo book, a school book, a diary, a fantasy album of military portraits.""","['Smyth sewing', 'laser printing']",,,The book's website,,Eighteen Publications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""As a number, ""a thousand several"" seems both rounded-off and vaguely supplemented. A thousand stands as a familiar figure of multitude. Several offers a convenient grasp of more-than-a-few. The scale may shift from one approximation to the next, but the desire to encompass persists. Yet within several lie sever and the adjective's original use to mean separate, individual, respective. ""A thousand several"" thus evokes a disparate rather than a whole number: not a multiple of one but a myriad of difference. A Thousand Several describes the profusion and dispersion that result from cuts: the cut of a cellphone call into social space, the cut away from that space in the ensuing conversation, the cut that every edit of attention makes. A Thousand Several draws an analogy between the uncollectible crowd that peoples a wireless sidewalk and the interrupted point of view of a pain-averse individual, who cuts off reminders of loss only to find them scattered for future ambush by this severance. Dashed rule, photo clips, and color separations lend their outlines, layers, and breaks to both ungathered company and parceled subject in A Thousand Several. Text appears as an intermittent line and recurs in extracted bits that shuffle themselves back into the feed. Written, designed, hand-set, and printed letterpress by Emily McVarish.

Edition 7 of 21. Signed by the artist. ""'A Three Thousand Light Year Journey' explores the concepts of time and space by constructing an accurately scaled 3D computer model of a section of the sky, created by the artist with CAD software and creating a musical composition using astronomical data. Using data obtained online from www.skybeautiful.com, a very small area of the celestial sphere was defined as Right Ascension between 5 hours and 6 hours (15 degrees on the 360 degree rotation of the Earth) and about 13 degrees above and below the celestial equator. This area, about six-tenths of one percent of the observable sky, contains the constellation Orion. Ninety stars, down to magnitude 6, were used in the 3D computer model which is illustrated in two ways: as a view from Earth as well as a 3D view from space. An additional 134 magnitude 6 stars were added to the 90 to make the transparent maps in the front of the book as well as the musical composition. These 224 stars are representative of what could possibly be seen in this sector of the sky, without optical aid, on a very dark night away from light pollution. This computer model does not include stars and objects that are farther away than three thousand light years or dimmer than magnitude 6. The star positions in the view from Earth illustration, with the familiar borders of Orion the Hunter, are transformed in the three dimensional image. Stars that appear very close together when seen from Earth can be very far apart. The magnitude or brightness of a star seen from Earth is given a numerical value and is called in astronomy the Apparent Magnitude. The actual brightness or Absolute Magnitude is determined by the Apparent Magnitude and the star's distance away from Earth, and can be many times greater in brightness than it appears to us. The musical journey uses pitch and the position between the left and right stereo channels to determine a star's location on the 15-degree by 26-degree grid that I have chosen for this project. A star's distance is expressed by the duration of time from the start of the composition, and its brightness is determined by the loudness and duration of the note representing the star. As the journey progresses, the tempo of the composition accelerates each 100 light years until we reach 3000 light years at the end of the composition.

The diary belonged to Yitzchak Rudashevski, a 15-year-old Jewish boy. The work is published in the original Yiddish and translated into Lithuanian. ""Yitzchak Rudashevski was born in Vilnius in 10 XII 1927 -- his father, Eliyahu, worked in a publishing house, and his mother, Rosa, was a seamstress. In September 1941, when Yitzchak was not yet 14 years old, the Nazis forced the boy and his family into the Vilna Ghetto. At some point during the Nazi occupation, Yitzchak started writing a diary in Yiddish where he described the day to day horrors the Jewish population had to endure. In the main part of the diary, which encompasses the period from September 1942 to April 1943, the young man chronicled all aspects of the ghetto, using his literary talents to not only describe, but also to reflect with great clarity and insight for a 15 year-old upon what was happening within the walls of the houses and streets he had been confined to. As the author himself put it, 'I consider that everything must be recorded and noted down, even the most gory, because everything will be taken into account.' In the fall of 1943, as the Vilna Ghetto was being liquidated, the Rudashevskis managed to hide away in a secret shelter, but after only two weeks the Nazis discovered their hiding place and executed everyone. Only Sarah Voloshin, Yitzchak's cousin, managed to escape and flee to the forests surrounding Vilna. After the Soviets re-occupied the town in the summer of 1944, she returned to the shelter and found a small notebook, its more than 200 pages filled with handwriting, some in pen, and some in pencil. It was the diary of Yitzchak Rudashevski. ""About the cover: The cover has been replaced by the author's portrait cut into halves and stitched to the publication. It was not the yellow star but a child's tragic destiny that was sewed to the book. Everyone who takes the diary into his hands gains power to cover the boy's eyes and thus spare and deliver him from the horror awaiting him in the near future. Let us grant him and the others exposed to this nonhuman tragedy the opportunity to hide into the outstretched palms of the reader. Let us try hard to identify any chances of survival -- both within the characters portrayed and within our memory. Yitzchak Rudashevski strength, a feeling of sadness over the years wasted in the Ghetto and unshakable faith in life is symbolized by the unique opportunity presented to the reader, that is, by connecting the two halves of the portrait. Basically, it means trying to put together something that can no longer be reunited. On the spine of the book, the pages are sewn and the inscription of Yitzchak Rudashevski's name is printed. The font used in the book of the inscription is that of the 'Yiddishkeit Vilna', believed to have been used by Yitzchak's father Elijah who worked at the 'Vilner tog' as a typesetter. The book has been intentionally stripped naked, as a token of remembrance of those who were stripped naked and forced to march to the Paneriai forest to be murdered. ""About the pages of the book: There are two beginnings within the book and no end. On the left is the Lithuanian introduction by Dr. Mindaugas Kvietkauskas and the translation of the original text, on the right you will find an original text in the Yiddish language. Both texts intersect at the place where the facsimiles of the diary are published. At the beginning of the Lithuanian text, the authentic documents and documentary photographs are published. At the start of the Yiddish diary, photography is presented metaphorically, thus offering the reader a new vantage point. Among them, several photos from the Vilna ghetto hideouts have been inserted.The publication is bilingual and has a double numbering. ""Today, the original diary is kept at YIVO in New York (an institute established in Vilnius in the 1920s for the research of Yiddish) and copies of the diary are in other archives, including the archive at Yad Vashem, Jerusalem. Translated and complied by Mindaugas Kvietkauskas Designed by Sigute Chlebinskaite Published by Lithuanian Jews Community Printed by Standartų spaustuvė Vilnius, Lithuania 2018"" -- publisher's note",,diaries,,The Lithuanian Jewish Community website's note on the publication of this title,,Lithuanian Jewish Community,,,Yitzchak Rudashevski,,,,,,,,Sigute Chlebinskaite,Standartu spaustuve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mindaugas Kvietkauskas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conrad writes in Heart of Darkness of the supposed comforts of the civilized worlds, the ""butcher round one corner, the policeman round another,"" both readily at hand to feed us and uphold our constructed laws. But our world and our universe are replete with natural forces far beyond human controls: What hope can Man hold against a hurricane? A meteor? A super-volcano? How can he persist when his buildings, the very monuments of his civilization, can topple in the breeze? Indeed, we are poised to destroy ourselves: Nuclear war remains an all-too-real possibility; global warming marches on unrelentingly; and our machines threaten to supplant humanity as the dominant 'life-forms,' gradually making us obsolete.

""Walt Whitman’s iconic collection of poems, 'Leaves of Grass', has earned a reputation as a sacred American text. Whitman himself made such comparisons, going so far as to use biblical verse as a model for his own. So it’s only appropriate that artist and illustrator Allen Crawford has chosen to illuminate--like medieval monks with their own holy scriptures—Whitman’s masterpiece and the core of his poetic vision, 'Song of Myself.' Crawford has turned the original sixty-page poem from Whitman’s 1855 edition into a sprawling 234-page work of art, available now in its second Tin House edition with a new cover in celebration of Whitman’s 200th birthday. The handwritten text and illustrations intermingle in a way that’s both surprising and wholly in tune with the spirit of the poem--they’re exuberant, rough, and wild. 'Whitman Illuminated: Song of Myself' is a sensational reading experience, an artifact in its own right, and a masterful tribute to the Good Gray Poet."" -- publisher's description","['hardcover books', 'illustrations', 'poetry']",,,Publisher's website,,Tin House Books,,Allen Crawford,Walt Whitman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Black and white. ""This document emerges from years of challenging and joyous conversations about the work we do with zines. As caretakers of these materials, in our roles as librarians and archivists -- independent, public and academic alike -- we believe in a set of core values that inform and guide our work. We disseminate those values here in order to communicate openly and build trust. This document aims to support you in asking questions, rather than to provide definitive answers. Guidelines may not apply uniformly to every situation, but include discussion of disputed points. This gives zine librarians and archivists ideas about what has been challenging in the past and how other zine custodians have dealt with those issues. These points can guide conversations with users, institutions, authors, donors, and communities--including other zine librarians and archivists. The Zine Librarians Code of Ethics is a tool to be used for acquiring, managing, preserving, and making accessible zines in a library setting, whether the collection is housed in a public, academic, or special library; an archives; or a basement. It is not intended to be prescriptive or the absolute word on the subject. We started drafting this at the 2014 Zine Librarians (un)Conference in Durham, NC and worked on it collaboratively over time and space. This is a snapshot of a living movement. We expect the Zine Librarians Code of Ethics to change over time, adapting as zine community mores evolve.

Open edition. This book documents interviews conducted with computer software developers to explore the aesthetic values in, and their fond feelings for, computer programming. Created for the 2002 exhibition BEAUT.E(CODE). Statement below: I am a visual artist. My husband is a software engineer. For years I have listened to his conversations with colleagues about hardware and software, what is good or pleasing and what is not and why, what they find new and exciting or classic and exciting. I am able to sense, but am unable to experience the excitement they feel. I wanted to find a point of entry into this world, and find a way to convey their excitement to other non-technical people. I gathered information by conducting group interviews with and sending questionnaires to computer professionals to explore aesthetic values in the art of computer programming and how they are similar to (or different from) aesthetic values in art. Or more plainly, ""what excites these guys?"" Three elements are combined to create the pieces in this show: quotes from the interviews which I thought best or most colorfully expressed these aesthetic values, representations of artifacts I remember fondly from my college days working in the machine room of the university's computer center circa 1980, and my simplistic understanding of the basic inner workings of a computer.","['computer science', 'interviews', 'punched cards']",,,Karen Hanmer's website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To me this phrase embodies the often melancholic and dark images of the book. ""I offset printed the cover and endsheets on Astrobright Black paper with metallic inks.

The gum pieces are wrapped in rice paper printed in red and black lettering with a 'chop' mark of a mouth with teeth. In order to open the book (or package) a string of dental floss must be unraveled at one end. Chewing Tzu is a work about reflection or rumination. The four sticks of gum symbolize the four stomachs of cows and other ruminants. Four is also significant in Chinese philosophies, such as the Four Elements, Four Causes, Four Characters, Four Forms, Four Kindnesses, Four Moral Qualities, Four Virtues, Four Wisdoms, Four Beginnings and Four Points of Argumentation, not to mention the four seasons. 'Tzu' is the equivalent of 'master.' Chuang recalls 'chewing,' so Chewing Tzu may be thought of as chewing the words of the master, which are often cryptic and non-sensical for the non-expert, especially when taken out of context. Chuang Tzu and Lao Tzu provide three of the statements. The remaining one is from the Taoist I Ching. I am happy to give you more specifics, but for now I don't want to spoil the performance. The sticks of gum must first be read, front and back, and then chewed and reflected upon, as each stick has a separate flavor that relates to the text. As Mencius said, 'There is a common taste for flavor in our mouths.' You will recognize the flavors. But you may be apprehensive as was one philosopher upon receiving a gift of medicine, citing, 'Not knowing its properties, I dare not taste it.' The performance depends on you. And besides, one out of four sticks is sugarless!"" -- Description taken from the artist's website.","['Taoism', ""artists' books"", 'gum', 'performance art']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Lao Tzu', 'Chuang Tzu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shaped drum leaf binding, 62 pages. Cinderella Ever After is a revisionist version of the oft-told tale. Housed in highly decorated heart-shaped covers and digitally printed interior pages featuring collages based on Schaer's suburban childhood - a world of idealized women and imaginary perfect homes. The images do not illustrate the text, but serve as counterpoint for the imagery in the poem. The book is covered by wrapped cords, resembling arteries that crawl over the laser cut, heart-shaped covers. The densely packed cords twist and turn in and out of the covers in a manner both embracing and strangling, an effect that could have only be produced by Schaer's intensive handwork. The shape of the book refers back to medieval codex structures, in which heart shaped books were often used for prayer, and to reflect a love of god.

Some of these encounters are slights, seeming slips of the tongue, and some are intentional offensives in the classroom, at the supermarket, at home, on the tennis court with Serena Williams and the soccer field with Zinedine Zidane, online, on TV--everywhere, all the time. The accumulative stresses come to bear on a person's ability to speak, perform, and stay alive. Our addressability is tied to the state of our belonging, Rankine argues, as are our assumptions and expectations of citizenship.

From back cover: ""Codex Espangliensis is a unique collaboration between performance artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena, visual artist Enrique Chagoya, and book artist Felicia Rice. Provocative and visually stunning, it chronicles the history of conquest, cultural transformation, and economic interdependence that has shaped the Americas 'from Columbus to the border patrol'. Inspired by pre-Hispanic codices, this artists' book opens from right to left, expanding out from accordion folds to a length of over twenty-one feet. Gomez-Pena's texts -- a heady mix of languages, accents, poetry, and prose -- are woven through and around Chagoya's collages layered with pre-Hispanic drawings, colonial-era representations of New World natives, and contemporary comic book superheroes. Rice's masterful typographic compositions orchestrate the many voices and views in a series of beautiful and jarring montages. Codex Espangliensis offers a history of the Americas which must be read forward and backward, in fragments and in recurring episodes -- in short, as history itself tends to unfold.""",,,,,,City Lights Books,Moving Parts Press,Enrique Chagoya,Guillermo Gómez-Peña,"Gómez-Peña, Guillermo [, Chagoya, Enrique, Rice, Felicia, Artists' books",,,,,,San Francisco,,,,,,,Felicia Rice,,,2000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hicks begins her story by trying to understand what coincidence means by definition and how this idea can be challenged. This simple question carries her through many subjects, revisting her interest in Napoleon and finding new points of interest in her child's singing, movies, her friend's experiences and so on. Similar to her continous stream of thought, imagery of marching ants acts as lines on a page throughout the entirty of the book. Ants are the only instance of coincidence on which Hicks focuses within this edition, sections of text being completely blocked by a swarm of ants, the writing only to be revealed with a pair of red lensed glasses the artist provides."" -- Brooklyn Artists Allience",,,,,,,,,,"Artists' books, Literature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I didn't expect was to find such a huge intersection between the stark facts about Big Dairy and ideas about oppression as they pertain to patriarchy and misogyny. Altering midcentury Elsie the Cow advertisements seemed a perfect vehicle for presenting the disturbing themes in these intertwined subjects with a bit of levity. Deconstructing Elsie weaves health, environmental, political, and ethical issues particular to the dairy industry with notions of gender and animal oppression and patriarchy.""","['advertising', 'dairy farms', 'environmental impact', 'political art', 'spiral bindings']",,,Artist's website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new edition is the first exact copy of Depero's groundbreaking monograph produced since its original publication ninety years ago. This exact facsimile - featuring five types of paper and meticulously recreated bolts - includes a wealth of Depero's influential paintings, sculptures, textile and architectural designs - any or all of which can be removed and displayed as individual pieces of art.

""As a guest artist selected to participate in ARTifariti 2009, Kahn stayed with Sahrawi families living in refugee camps in Algeria and in the desert of The Free Territories of the Western Sahara. There she created the collages for this publication by combining the sparse materials available locally with photos, recipes, histories and drawings. The result is a 50-page full-color journal that examines the art of Sahrawi food production: how kitchens are improvised, food is procured and prepared, and traditional recipes are innovated from UN rations and international aid. The book is a testament to the daily struggles of Sahrawi women whose role is to provide sustenance, fortitude and comfort inside a compromised society."" - from http://halfletterpress.com","['cookbooks', 'refugee camps']",,,,,Autonomedia,,,,,,,,,,Brooklyn,,,,,,,,,,2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""My painted book series expresses an attempt to reclaim the female’s body and self-knowledge. It is an ideological stance that is imagined and gestured in the solitude of drawing, through the weaving of images that narrate and textualize womanhood within the intimacy of the inked belly of printed books. By turning the pages, different aspects of women’s lives are represented. I have seen a similarity between the intimacy of the house and the interior of the book—both are activated by characters and objects that give narrative potential to a given space. I have started to show woman as the source of narration and meaning and also tried to align my work with the desire for female emancipation."" -- artist's statment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""This is the 54th edition in our collaborative book series in the Typography and the Book Arts class. Most of the elements of this book were not printed, which is unusual for our semester book project. All the drawings were hand-copied from the students' original master drawings using light tables. The students drew with a Uniball Signo .38 pen. The colorizing was by pochoir using Duralar hand-cut stencils and Color Box pigment pads. The text type is 12 pt. Centaur and Arrighi, small and delicate. We chose Somerset Satin as the text paper because it takes drawings so well. The simple paper binding utilizes Arches Cover Black. The cover image was drawn with a white pen."" -colophon ""The relationship between the four dimensions: line, area, volume and time, were the focus of this class. We started by drawing from nature, drawing only the edges of leaves and flowers in a continuous line, in order to explore the boundary. Next we allowed lines to intersect, creating areas, which demanded to be filled with color. This led us to choose colors which followed the seasons, starting with winter. To depict volume, we overlapped and lifted images off the page. The time element was reflected in the changing of the seasons, as well as the time it took to produce the original drawings and get each process done in a timely fashion. The spare text was developed after the images were finalized. In the end, we wanted the images to be just out of reach of recognition."" -foreword","['Graphic design (Typography)', 'design drawings']",,,,,Scripps College Press,,,"['Noor Asif', 'Najla Bulous', 'Tara Contractor', 'May Lynn Forssen', 'Jing Gu', 'Ashley Minnis-Lemley', 'Star Schneider', 'Cassidy Shea', 'Zipporah Smith', 'Anna Wilner']",,Kitty Maryatt,,,,,,,,,,,Claremont,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lynndie England, the young female army officer shown smiling devilishly as she humiliated male prisoners, became first a scapegoat and then a victim who was ""just following orders."" Ignored were the more elemental questions of how women are functioning within conservative power structures of government and the military. Why do the military and the CIA use female sexuality as an interrogation tactic, and why is this tactic downplayed and even ignored in internal investigations of prisoner abuse? Combining an art project with critical commentary, Coco Fusco imaginatively addresses the role of women in the war on terror and explores how female sexuality is being used as a weapon against suspected Islamic terrorists. Using details drawn from actual accounts of detainee treatment in US military prisons, Fusco conceives a field guide of instructional drawings that prompts urgent questions regarding the moral dilemma of torture in general and the use of female sexuality specifically. Fusco assesses what these matters suggest about how the military and the state use sex, sexuality, and originally feminist notions of sexual freedom""--Seven Stories Press website","[""artists' books"", 'feminism', 'gender issues', 'military prisons', 'sex role', 'soldiers', 'terrorism', 'torturing']",,,Seven Stories Press,,Seven Stories Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first book has all her poems divided in three sections, the other is saddle bound with facsimiles and loose sheets from her archive. They are contained by a dust jacket with a ribbon, in a printed serigraphy envelope with a bookmark and a poster. Printed and bound by Ex Libris Press. Edition number 366 of 500. ""Miyo Vestrini was born in Nimes, France, in 1938; she moved to Venezuela with her family nine years later. Vestrini was, at 17, a member of the avant-garde group Apocalipsis, strongly influenced by surrealist ideas and imagery. In spite of this, her poetry is closer to the existential concerns and political engagement of El Techo de la Ballena (1961) and 40 Grados a la Sombra (1964). Vestrini's first book, Las historias de Giovanna (1971) is a narrative mixture of verse and prose which recounts a woman's life--not different from that of the author. In it, we find some themes which would become common threads in her subsequent work--the complexity of female experience, the constant sense of strangeness and exclusion, and the difficulty of love. The poems in 'Es una buena maquina' confirm her unvarying motifs and her melancholy voice, as exemplified in these lines: 'After they lifted up my dead body/I wasn't asked how I felt.'

The accompanying captions are quotes from newspapers and librarian's notes. The Modified Mercalli Scale is a descriptive and graphic alternative to the Richter Scale, that quantifies how strongly an earthquake affects the Earth's surface, humans, man-made objects and nature, on a scale of I through XII. Topographic maps of earthquake areas use the Mercalli Scale color code to indicate how far away from the epicenter the earthquake was felt and at what degree of intensity.

""Fascicular excerpta from a computer coined Abecedary.""--Front matter. ""Forever Amber at Zebra Crossing is formed from eight short scripts which were first arranged as a form of 'tape loop' to provide a plentiful supply of raw if repetitive material for a large studio based collage. However a developing interest in the wide range of fragmentation, compositional and typographic attributes of computer 'desktop publishing' programs, led me to transfer the eight fragment of text to disk to 're-release' them via two edited printer fonts adapted from standard typefaces to become re-formed as hieroglyphic letterforms; replacing the original text with one which was, as a consequence, largely indecipherable (even with the aid of subtitles). The process is one which can be applied to every letter, number or punctuation mark ever printed from disk, and moreover it can be almost infinitely varied or redefined according to whim; this modest booklet is published more as a serving suggestion than an exhaustive 'compendium of possibilities'. Forever Amber at Zebra Crossing was composed on an Atari ST using SoftLogik DTP programs and public domain font editing software.""--AfterWord.","['computer art', 'pamphlet bindings']",,,,,JPR Instone Publications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the 1980s and 90s, the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum in Boston and the Earl of Bath's residence in England both lost some of their most prestigious works to thefts and accidents. In this volume, which combines her series on both museums, Sophie Calle embarks on a quest to resurrect the memory of these pieces. She explores their personal meaning to those museum employees and others who knew the works intimately, in a series of profiles on each individual. Contents: Ghosts -- Last seen.

5551,Ginza Haccho,Accordion books,185,FA.SA1.2084,Fine Art Collection,7.1 x 165.4 in; 18 x 420 cm,NA,Michalis Pichler,"Accordion book of photographs documenting each building on Ginza Street in Tokyo, Japan. Inspired by a previous iteration of a similar work of art by Yoshikazu Suzuki. Softcover, offset printed in black and white, accordion bindings, housed in a silver slipcase. Edition of 1000. ""In 1954 Japanese writer and artist Shohachi Kimura published GINZA HACCHO, with photographs by Yoshikazu Suzuki of every building on Ginza Street in Tokyo as an accordion foldout book. Twelve years later, Edward Ruscha published EVERY BUILDING ON THE SUNSET STRIP in almost exactly the same style. While the latter has become a touchstone of conceptual publications and artists' books, its predecessor remains largely unknown. ""Appropriating Shohachi Kimura's (and Ed Ruscha's) work, Michalis Pichler's accordion-folded book opens up to a fourteen-foot strip of photographs of EVERY BUILDING ON THE GINZA STREET of today, each building identified by a street number. Crossroads are also identified with captions. Photographed from a car driving past, the individual photos were then pasted together to make the long accordion fold. Paper joins are visible throughout the book. Pichler's version offers a modern update, depicting Ginza street in contemporary Tokyo, where the facades are dominated by glamorous high-end global fashion and luxury brands mixed with local heavyweights: SWAROWSKI, Folli Follie, MONTBLANC, YAMAHA, RIMOVA, ZARA, CELINE, G SIX, VALENTINO, FENDI, GEOX, PRADA, SONY, NISSAN, MITSUKOSHI, MATSUYA GINZA and LOUIS VUITTON dominating a whole block, BULGARI, TIFFANY, NOVARESE, UGG, KIRA RITO GINZA, Samsonite, Tocca and others on the East-Side. On the West-Side, a similar parade of name-dropping takes place. Within Pichler's body of work EVERY BUILDING ON THE GINZA STRIP / GINZA HACCHO represents a piece of serial photography, urban phenomenology, ambiguous social critique and art history karaoke. In a critical essay on appropriation (2009), Pichler discussed techniques of appropriation employed (often combined) in books today, and related the books of Ed Ruscha to its Japanese predecessors."" -- artist's statement","['Accordion books', 'black-and-white photographs', 'slipcases']",,,,,"['Kodoji Press', 'Greatest Hits']",,,,,,,,,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rothko, a memoir of a year spent in the mountains living and working in a license plate shed, is a dramatized account of a lived experience. The nine-chapter narrative also contains a polemic about regional painting's relevance in a world in which the United Sates might be a regional, rather than international power, and in an art world in which established methods of critical art- predicated on negation, subversion, parody and deconstruction-seem increasingly ineffective. Instead, it proposes a kind of creative critique based on invention and synthesis, the privileged form of which is fiction. In Rothko's own words, 'Regionalism is not a style, but a mode of and model for making. It not so much suspends the viewer's disbelief as it enables an artist to suspend his self consciousness. The respite from criticality opens a fictive space where a conceptual artist can be a painter,a painter a writer, an art dealer a publisher...Regionalism is the protective shell that allows us to be real artists again.'

Edition number 97 of 500. ""Miyo Vestrini (1938-1991) is considered today a major Venezuelan poet--the critic Julio Miranda described her as one of the most engaging poets of her generation. Simultaneously, Vestrini was a widely admired cultural journalist: she received the National Journalism Award in 1967 and 1979. Her book-length conversations with writers Isaac Chocron and Salvador Garmendia go beyond the regular format of oral exchanges by introducing the accoutrements of literary chronicles and the nuances of autobiographical asides. The interviews collected here were originally published in El Nacional newspaper from 1980 to 1981. In these pages, readers will come across an assorted cast of characters: fellow writers and reporters, poets with a background in Medicine or with a degree in Law, a novelist who moonlighted as a solemn politician, a filmmaker, an actor, an Army Colonel, an undertaker'...

'A Love Supreme' confirms his standing as one of the finest voices of his generation. Its subtitle--Shakespeare: Variations--posits the conceptual basis for the book: Salas brings on the accretion of 17 of Shakespeare's sonnets with the purpose of showing their potential as instigators of modern texts. He does so by translating literally, breaking the syntax of the resulting sonetos, adding words, pulling out entire sections, injecting seemingly personal anecdotes, creating haiku-like versions, striking through full sentences to reveal abridged lyrics and epigrams... With 'A Love Supreme,' Adalber Salas has knowingly inserted himself in the tradition of those who conceive of translation as an exacting mask of recreation--Ezra Pound, Octavio Paz, Haroldo de Campos."" -- artist's statement",,poetry,,Artist's website,,Letra Muerta,,,Adalber Salas,,,,,,,,,Ex Libris Press,,,,,Ex Libris Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Letterpress printing and photography. ""The photographs in 'Light Experiments' focus on bodily abstractions and the feeling of being estranged from oneself, one's surroundings, and even one's sense of identity. They are layered explorations of people and spaces that feel both familiar and unfamiliar to me. The photographs reflect the way visual, emotional, and physical moments are superimposed, using visual intersections to create a single image that becomes almost otherworldly. I experimented with light using the camera as my medium, seeking to evoke the same energy and sensations that language-based poetry might. In 'A Poet's Glossary,' Edward Hirsch tells us that 'the word ""stanza"" means ""room"" in Italian. -- ""a station,"" ""a stopping place,""-- and each stanza in a poem is like a room in a house, a lyric dwelling place.' I approached the nocturnal settings of these photographs as dwelling places, poetic atmospheres haunted and connected by a fleeting pulse of light, dream worlds and departures toward the unknown. Hirsch writes, 'Each stanza has its own distinctive features, its own music, and its own internal history that informs and haunts later usage.' Using the materials I had -- matches, sparklers, moonlight, sequins, timers, apertures, flash, motion, layers, levels, fabric, and of course, my camera -- I sought to bring this internal history to the surface of the photograph. This photographic chapbook has no linear narrative, and constructs an experience that will be different for every viewer. I conceived of 'Light Experiments' as an adventure -- a dislocating contemplation that aims to bend genre by challenging ideas surrounding what it means to write poetry."" -- artist's statement","['chapbooks', 'pamphlet bindings', 'photography', 'poetry']",,,Artist's website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the colophon: ""In the early morning on April 19, 2013 Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick ordered residents of Watertown, our home town, and surrounding cities and towns to 'shelter-in-place,' to stay inside their homes initiating a manhunt for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The previous night Tsarnaev's brother Tamerlan had been killed in a shootout with police in Watertown, but the younger brother eluded capture and escaped, abandoning his car a few blocks away from the shoot-out. A vast military style manhunt was soon underway, one of the largest in the history of the United States. A twenty block area of Watertown was cordoned off by thousands of police, and numerous SWAT teams were ordered to search every home in this target area. For an entire day and into the evening we stayed indoors, watching out our windows as tanks and heavily armed soldiers went door to door, searched yards, under porches and in some blocks inside homes, as well. During the course of the lockdown many residents were ordered out of their homes without the authority of a search warrant, strip searched, and taken into police custody. At 6 pm, having failed to find Tsarnaev, Governor Patrick lifted the 'shelter-in-place' order and we were able to come outside to ponder whether the bombing suspect had escaped the area or perhaps might still be hiding nearby. An hour and a half later a resident who lived inside the search area walked into his backyard and noticed that the cover on his boat was loose. Looking under the tarp he discovered Tsarnaev alive, but lying in a pool of blood, and notified police. The ordeal had finally ended. The book, 'Lockdown Archive', is a collection of images all found on the web and reorganized chronologically, by category and by location, in order to provide an encyclopedic overview of the manhunt.""",,,,,,Eighteen Publications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The book is a compilation of works over the past three years touching on themes of gender and sexuality in relation to fantastical positions of witchcraft, interplanetary space, cowboy and creation mythologies. This collection of poetry explores a metaphor described in the celestial body of Ceres, the largest object in our solar system's asteroid belt which divides the system between inner and outer planets, as a self portrait existing on the border of an inclusive community and that of an exterior nebulous expanse. Love Poems for Ceres looks at a relationship to a subject who is unable to reciprocate, orbiting an undefined position, and in doing so recounts a fleeting attempt to position oneself against the cosmos within. The poems in this collection have been presented in part or in full at the Contemporary Art Centre (Vilnius), KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Spike Art, Exile Gallery, Gillmeier Rech & Import Projects (Berlin). Love Poems for Ceres will be launched this September at Art Metropole alongside a solo exhibition by the artist at Franz Kaka gallery in Toronto."" -- publisher's website","['perfect bindings', 'poetry']",,,Publisher's website,,Broken Dimanche Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chief Pokagon, or Simon Pokagon, was nicknamed by the press as the 'Redskin poet, bard, and Longfellow of his race.' He was a full-blooded Native American and a member of the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians that once dwelled in the Great Plains of North America. An activist, writer, and poet, Chief Pokagon fought for the fair treatment of Native American people. In this article, Chief Pokagon describes his awe for what we know as the passenger pigeon. Additionally, he accounts the way that white Americans were killing the species by the masses. He compares this to the way that his own people were killing the bird while also ensuring the species' sustainability. ""Today, the passenger pigeons are extinct and the Potawatomi people were displaced from their lands during the American removal period between 1830-1840. Considering this, it seemed fitting for the inaugural issue of Martha's Quarterly to present this text as a way to allude to the precarious issues within today's environment and how we care for people who are different from us. ""Passenger Pigeon Press takes its name after the passenger pigeon because of the species' rich identity within its environment and our human culture. This bird's tale is also a history of exploitation and displacement by humans which ultimately lead to its own demise. Martha's Quarterly is named after Martha, the last passenger pigeon who died in 1914 at the Cincinnati Zoo."" -- Tammy Nguyen ""Martha's Quarterly, Issue 1, Fall 2016, uses the text 'The Wild Pigeon of North America' by Chief Pokagon, which appeared in 'The Chautaquan' in November 18195, Volume 22, Number 20.

Work consists of images of covers Agatha Christie's ""They Came to Baghdad"" published in very countries around the world. From colophon: ""On March 5, 2007, a car bomb was exploded on Al-Mutanabbi Street in Baghdad. Al-Mutanabbi Street is in a mixed Shia-Sunni area. More than 30 people were killed and more than 100 were wounded. Al-Mutanabbi Street, the historic center of Baghdad bookselling, holds bookstores and outdoor bookstalls, cafes, stationary, tea, and tobacco shops. It has been an integral center of the Baghdad literary and intellectual community. This book, 'They Came to Baghdad', is a response to The Al-Mutanabbi Street Coalition's call for 130 book artists to 're-assemble' some of the 'inventory' of the reading material that was lost in the car bombing. One complete set has been donated to the Iraq National Library. The other two sets are employed as exhibitions in Europe and the U.S. to raise funds for Medecins Sans Frontieres."" Statement from the artists: ""'Baghdad is the chosen location for a secret superpower meeting' in Agatha Christie's, 'They Came to Baghdad' which has been translated into more than 30 languages and has been published continuously since it first appeared in England in 1951. In our book, They Came to Baghdad, Christie's 40 book covers conjure an exotic site for diplomatic, and romantic intrigue. They parallel the second chapter, excerpts and images of the 40 countries that have participated in the Multi-National Force deploying troops to Iraq between 2003 and 2011. In our final chapter, the invasion continues; it's an index of corporate logos of the contractors hired for the reconstruction of Iraq and the major foreign investors involved. The work is based entirely on websearch, not only from traditional media sources, but also from alternative sources that have now entered the public sphere. From ebay and amazon, blog entries around the world translated through Google Translate, flickr and myspace all contributed to our visual narrative.""",,,,,,Eighteen Publications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mike Mandel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
